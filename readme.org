#+title: deprecated, functionality is moved to hmisc

Statically typed wrappers for various markup lanuages - grapvhiz, svg,
openscad, latex. Allows easier generation - library takes care of as
much edge cases as possible, and composition - instead of ropes and
string interpolation all over the place you can use (somewhat)
statically typed API with lots of helper functions.

** Installation

#+begin_src bash
nimble install hasts
#+end_src

** Links

- [[https://github.com/haxscramper/hasts][github]]
- [[https://haxscramper.github.io/hasts-doc/src/hasts/graphviz_ast.html][documentation]]
- [[https://nimble.directory/pkg/hasts][nimble package]]

** Usage

Most of the markup ast nodes has lots of fields - providing
parametetric constructor functions for all of them would be really
tedious to implement. Instead ~withIt~ template from
[[https://github.com/haxscramper/hmisc#hmiscalgohalgorithm-documentation][hmisc/algo/halgorithm]] might be used for constructing ast element and
setting all fields immediately.

#+begin_src nim :exports both
import hasts/graphviz_ast
import hmisc/algo/halgorithm

var g = makeDotGraph()
g.styleNode.shape = nsaEgg
for i in 0 .. 5:
  g.addEdge makeEdge(i, i * 2)
  g.addNode makeNode(i, "Position " & $i).withIt do:
    it.height = i.float

echo g
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
digraph G {
  node[shape=egg];
  t0[label="Position 0"];
  t1[label="Position 1", height=1.0];
  t2[label="Position 2", height=2.0];
  t3[label="Position 3", height=3.0];
  t4[label="Position 4", height=4.0];
  t5[label="Position 5", height=5.0];
  t0 -> t0;
  t1 -> t2;
  t2 -> t4;
  t3 -> t6;
  t4 -> t8;
  t5 -> t10;
}
#+end_example

Parially implemented (not 100% coverage, but most important parts are
present)

- graphviz
- openscad
- svg
- html

WIP

- latex
- latex math
- pandoc

* Conitribution & development

- [ ] REFACTOR: use regular strings instead of ropes for AST
  conversion.

Most of the features in the library are implemented on as-needed
basis. If you have any question about implementation details or API
