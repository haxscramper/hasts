#+title: readme

Statically typed wrappers for various markup lanuages - grapvhiz, svg,
openscad, latex. Allows easier generation - library takes care of as
much edge cases as possible, and composition - instead of ropes and
string interpolation all over the place you can use (somewhat)
statically typed API with lots of helper functions.

Parially implemented (not 100% coverage, but most important parts are
present)

- graphviz
- openscad
- svg
- html

WIP

- latex
- latex math
- pandoc

Most of the features in the library are implemented on as-needed
basis. If you have any question about implementation details or API
